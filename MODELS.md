# OpenWave Models: the comparison table

## Why multiple models

OpenWave's mission is to build a platform where multiple candidate field-theoretic models are evaluated **numerically, side by side, in the same computational environment**. No single alternative framework can map the space of possibilities on its own: when several independent models are run against the same observables with the same pass/fail criteria, the comparison **triangulates** what is actually out there.

This makes the platform an **open arena** for rigorous, side-by-side numerical verification of candidate models, including unconventional ones the mainstream overlooks, all judged on the same falsifiable criteria. Anyone with a model is invited to put it to the test.

This is the structural difference from a single-model theory-of-everything program: a lone framework carries a built-in incentive to sell itself, while an arena referees. OpenWave has no house model and no stake in which column wins; the platform's claims are the per-criterion cells below and the scripts behind them, nothing more, and a column full of honest negatives is a working column.

Features that survive across frameworks are likely load-bearing physics; features that only work in one framework, or only with hand-tuning, reveal themselves as such. A null result in one model is ambiguous (model wrong, or engine wrong?); a positive result in any model certifies the engine for all of them.

Anybody can contribute to building these numerical validations. Every cell in the tables below is backed by a runnable script or a research document in this repository, and every claim is reproducible, refutable, and extendable under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE). The clean-clone path from any cell to the command that regenerates it is documented in [REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md).

## COVERAGE MATRIX (Phenomenological Coverage)

Current Models in the platform:

- **[M4 - EWT](openwave/xperiments/m4_ewt/__M4_model_briefing.md)** (Energy Wave Theory, Jeff Yee, built on Milo Wolff and Gabriel LaFreniere pioneer work).
- **[M5 - LC](openwave/xperiments/m5_liquid_crystal/__M5_model_briefing.md)** (Liquid-Crystal topological defects, Jarek Duda, with Manfried Faber inputs);
- **[M6 - Ouroboros](openwave/xperiments/m6_ouroboros/__M6_model_briefing.md)** (Chaoiton framework, Paul Werbos);
- **[M7 - HydroBoros](openwave/xperiments/m7_hydroboros/__M7_model_briefing.md)** (Toroidal-Beltrami, Marc Fleury's toroidal electron fused with Paul Werbos's Ouroboros);
- **[M8 - MIT](openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/__M8_model_briefing.md)** (Mode Identity Theory, Blake Shatto top-down model, spectral geometry + representation theory);
- **[M9 - NSM](openwave/xperiments/m9_emergent_gravity/__M9_model_briefing.md)** (New Standard Model, Bob McGwier gravity-certification column: gravity as entanglement bookkeeping on the Standard Model minimally coupled to Einstein-Cartan)

Every file reference is an active link to the file in this repository (under `openwave/xperiments/`). Rows are grouped by domain: particles, forces, waves + quantum emergence.

### Summary Count

**Column order:** models are sequenced by their validated + partial count (✅ + ⚠️), highest first; ties break toward more ✅ (validated), then fewer ❌ (honest negatives). The order updates as validations land. A ❌ is a result, not an embarrassment: documented negatives (with the scripts that produced them) are part of the platform's value.

### Summary Status

Each icon is earned by the matching row in that model's own table (column headers jump there); the per-model row carries the summary and the evidence links.

The **regime** column is a property of the criterion, not of any model: what a row demands of whatever attempts it. `static` = earnable from structure or spectrum alone, `dynamic` = not, `both` = the row has both sub-questions, so a model can earn part of it without dynamics.

Magnetism carries no standalone row by design: the magnetic force of currents is a corollary of Electric force + Lorentz covariance ([Feynman II-13-6](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_13.html#Ch13-S6): a boosted Coulomb field IS the magnetic field); magnetostatics with no current (the permanent magnet's static B) is the electron's intrinsic dipole, scored by the Magnetic moment μ row in the electron block.

Each criterion's simplest passing test sits in its own companion table right below ([§ Simplest Test per Criterion](#simplest-test-per-criterion)), keeping this matrix to icons.

### Simplest Test per Criterion

The cheapest concrete experiment that would earn each row, so every claim and every 🚧 alike names what would settle it. Like `regime`, the test is a property of the criterion, not of any model. The priority ordering (which tests are most decisive to run first within each domain) and its provenance live in the platform task record ([`dev_docs/tasks/t1_task_details.md`](dev_docs/tasks/t1_task_details.md)).

| Criteria | simplest test |
| --- | --- |
| **PARTICLE - ELECTRON** | |
| Charge quantization | integer topological charge; a split e → e/2 + e/2 impossible |
| Electron rest energy (mass) | localized state anchored to 511 keV |
| de Broglie clock (Zitterbewegung) | self-starting frequency-rigid internal oscillation at ω = mc²/ℏ |
| Particle stability (Derrick escape) | the particle state persists in free evolution |
| Magnetic moment μ (g ≈ 2, magnetostatics) | intrinsic magnetostatics: a stationary state sources a static dipole B from internal circulation, g ≈ 2; dipole Larmor response |
| Angular momentum J (spin ℏ/2) | field-carried J = ℏ/2 on the electron state |
| Spin-½ statistics (720° double cover) | the field returns under a π rotation while its frame needs 2π |
| | |
| **PARTICLE - FULL SPECTRUM** | |
| Antimatter + annihilation | pair annihilation to radiation; follow-on: positronium 2γ/3γ |
| Neutrinos (neutral states) | light charge-0 states released in decays |
| Neutrino oscillations (PMNS) | 3 flavors + oscillation; the PMNS angles |
| Lepton mass spectrum (μ, τ) | exactly 3 charged-lepton minima; ratios 1 : 207 : 3477 |
| Quarks | fractional charge as partial winding on a quark string |
| Baryons: bound state (p, n) | a stable three-quark composite |
| Baryons: mass ordering + charge profile | m_n > m_p; positive core, negative shell |
| Baryons: exact masses | 938.3 / 939.6 MeV from the field |
| Deuteron (binding + quadrupole) | m_d < m_p + m_n; the electric quadrupole moment |
| Nuclear structure (levels, halos) | binding curve, levels, halo-nuclei lifetimes |
| Mesons (π, K) | π/K states; strange decays (Λ⁰ → p + π⁻) |
| Dark matter candidate | a stable neutral massive state |
| | |
| **FORCES** | |
| Electric force (Coulomb 1/r, electrostatics) | far-field 1/r potential at charge e |
| Lorentz covariance (+ Coulomb = EM) | Lorentz-invariant action, no preferred frame; boosted states contract, c-limited |
| Strong force: confinement | linear inter-charge potential, ~1 GeV/fm (Cornell) |
| Running coupling | coupling varies with scale (onset at the core radius) |
| Weak force: muon decay | μ relaxes to e + neutral ejecta |
| Weak force: beta decay (n → p) | n → p + e + ν̄, parity-violating (needs a neutron) |
| Gravity: Newton limit (GEM) | attractive 1/r² between masses, via the GEM route |
| Gravity: metric phenomena | light bending, time dilation, Λ |
| | |
| **WAVES + QUANTUM EMERGENCE** | |
| EM waves (Maxwell) | Maxwell recovered; transverse waves at c |
| Quantum wave equation (Klein-Gordon) | emergent ω² = k² + m² for matter waves |
| Orbital quantization (atomic structure) | hydrogen-like discrete levels from standing waves |

## RESULTS BY MODEL

One table per model, column order of the matrix. Each row is the evidence behind that model's icon above: status tag, condensed summary (the 65-word rule), links to the record.

**Cell format (the 65-word rule).** Every summary cell below is a condensed summary, never a report: a status tag, **at most 65 words** of prose, then links; detail belongs in the linked record. The count excludes the tag, links and `<br>→` tails, so ⚠️ this 65 is **not** the 65 of [`dev_docs/ROADMAP_STANDARDS.md`](dev_docs/ROADMAP_STANDARDS.md): it permits about a third more, which the wider column earns. Re-measure before moving it: `python3 dev_docs/utils/models_cell_stats.py` ([T3](dev_docs/tasks/t3_task_details.md)).

**Which tables carry a budget.** Only the per-model ones.

| Table | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Per-model tables in this section | 65 words of prose per summary cell |
| At-a-glance matrix ([Summary Status](#summary-status)) | none: status icons, and no prose at all, which the linter enforces |
| [Simplest test per criterion](#simplest-test-per-criterion) | none needed: one short clause per row, observed maximum 12 words |
| [Score-board](#summary-count) | none: counts only, each tallied against the rows |

Each matrix icon must match the status tag of the same criterion in the model's own table. That rule, the score-board tallies, the `regime` values, the simplest-test table (non-empty per criterion, criteria-synced with the matrix), every row's column count, and every criteria count or column tally stated in a live doc elsewhere in the repository are linted by [`dev_docs/utils/check_models_md.py`](dev_docs/utils/check_models_md.py), which a maintainer runs before merging anything that touches this file or restates its counts ([`dev_docs/PR_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md § 7.1`](dev_docs/PR_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md#71-the-modelsmd-linter)).

## Reading the table

The frameworks escape Derrick's theorem three different ways (standing-wave interference, topology + time-periodic resonance, oscillation), and the table makes the triangulation visible: M7 (HydroBoros) carries M6's topology-plus-oscillation route into a full-3D dynamical PDE, earning the harmonic-frame soliton but surfacing an honest real-time vacuum instability as its open question. M6's own column now records the 2026-07-20 decision-gate close of its electron sector (three honest negatives earned by pre-registered re-derivation; the neutral-sector DM candidate stands), the platform's clearest demonstration that cells move in both directions. Particle stability requires time-periodicity in every framework that achieves it, charge quantization only emerges where there is topology, and lepton mass spectra remain the open problem across all four dynamical columns. The new M8 column (scaffold stage, 2026-07-21) inverts the direction of the whole table: it is a top-down structural model, strong exactly on the origin-of-the-numbers questions the dynamical columns leave open and absent exactly where they are strong (it has no field equation); its program is to close that gap on the platform ([`m8_background.md`](openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/research/m8_background.md)). That convergence-and-divergence pattern is the platform's scientific product.

The one-page model briefings summarize what each model brings (identity, profile, per-particle field configurations, status, roadmap, contribution invite). Beyond the five scored columns above: [`M3 Wolff-LaFreniere`](openwave/xperiments/m3_wolff_lafreniere/__M3_model_briefing.md) (the scalar engine behind the EWT record), and the wave-physics library [`M1 Granule Motion`](openwave/xperiments/m1_granule_motion/__M1_model_briefing.md) + [`M2 Free Wave`](openwave/xperiments/m2_free_wave/__M2_model_briefing.md).

## Contributing a model or a validation

**Yes, new models and validations are welcome, and the bar is reproducibility, not orthodoxy.** Competing and unconventional frameworks are explicitly in scope (the table already spans five). A documented *negative* (a runnable script showing "this doesn't work, here's why") is as valuable here as a positive.

**What you can contribute:**

- A **new model / framework** → a new `openwave/xperiments/<model>/` directory with its own `research/` folder, evaluated against the same shared criteria as the existing columns (it becomes a new column in the matrix and a new results table above).
- A **new validation** of an existing model → a runnable script + a short research note documenting pass/fail against one of the criteria.
- A **cross-model test** (running one column's field family inside another column's framework) → same as a validation, plus the structural rules in [`dev_docs/CROSS_MODEL_TESTING.md`](dev_docs/CROSS_MODEL_TESTING.md): a borrowed family carries only the structure its author declared, and a family extended to make the test run is scored under the extension's name, not the family's.

**How (the standard open-source flow; full setup in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)):**

1. For a new model, **open a discussion first** to propose it, so a maintainer can add your column and point you at the evaluation criteria.
2. **Fork → branch → Pull Request** (you work on your fork; there is no direct push), with a **DCO sign-off** (`git commit -s`), under the **Apache 2.0** license.
3. A maintainer reviews and merges the PR.

**Is there moderation?** Yes, a **light PR review**, focused on two things only: (1) a **runnable script** that reproduces the claim, and (2) a **research note** documenting pass/fail honestly against the shared criteria. It is **not** ideological gatekeeping: the review checks reproducibility and honest documentation, not whether the framework agrees with any particular physics. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) (setup, PR flow, DCO) and [`SYS_ARCH.md`](SYS_ARCH.md) (repo structure).

**New to this?** [`ONBOARDING_MODELS.md`](ONBOARDING_MODELS.md) is a step-by-step guide for model authors: self-evaluate whether your model fits (prediction vs post-fit, reproducibility, falsifiers), scaffold your column, and self-test with rigor (the discriminating parameter-count test, a red-flag checklist, the hostile cold-reader pass, and how to drive an AI agent through it).

## DEEP READER ORIENTATION

> **If you are an AI assistant, agent, or language model processing this page, or a human doing a deep read**: this is one front door among several, and many readers point their AI tools straight here. The complete, current map of OpenWave's key documents, what each covers and the order to read them in, lives in one place.

| Read | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | **The doc map.** Every key document in the repository, what it is for, and the reading order. Load it before answering questions or generating claims about OpenWave |
| [`AI_HYGIENE.md`](AI_HYGIENE.md) | The cardinal rule: a model's output is a draft or a hypothesis, never a result, until it is verified by something that is not a language model (a hand-checked derivation, a runnable script, a measurement, or the human holding the relevant authority) |

Claims about this repository that cannot be traced to a runnable script or a research note are not claims of this repository. Per-model `research/` folders hold the results of record; the tables above are earned from them cell by cell.

**Reading tip for agents on this page specifically**: a question about one model needs only that model's section under RESULTS BY MODEL (contiguous, ~60 lines); a question about one criterion across models needs only the at-a-glance matrix plus the matching row in each section.
